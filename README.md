# Loan Approval Prediction

With record inflation and a struggling economy it is common place to see people apply for loans with the hopes that they will be approved and granted an exorbitant amount of money that could possibly change their lives. We created a loan approval prediction system that will give the user a way to know beforehand if they will get approved for a loan. For the predictor we used random forest, decision tree,logistic regression, and k-nearest sneighbor models to find the most accurate way to predict if someone will be approved.
