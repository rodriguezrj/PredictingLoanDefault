# Loan Approval Prediction

With record inflation and a struggling economy it is common place to see people apply for loans with the hopes that they will be approved and granted an exorbitant amount of money that could possibly change their lives. We created a loan approval prediction system that will give the user a way to know beforehand if they will get approved for a loan. For the predictor we used random forest, decision tree,logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbor models to find the most accurate way to predict if someone will be approved.

# Project Overview
Our project is a loan approval predictor that will factor in: gender, marital status, dependents, education, employment, income, loan amount, loan amount term, credit history, and property area. Our target is to use machine learning to accurately predict loan payments. We used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models.


# Data Understanding
The dataset that we are using for the project is named "Loan Prediction Dataset" through kaggle. The dataset contains a set of 613 records under 13 attributes.


# Data Analysis
Throughout this project we leveraged Kaggle, a reputable data repository, to acquire a comprehensive loan applicant dataset.Then we conducted a thorough review process to ensure data alignment with project requirements and suitability for machine learning modeling. After that we cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and usability. We also filled NaN data with Mode (categorical) and Mean (numerical) and changed the Test/Train percentages at increments to find the best accuracy for each model.
